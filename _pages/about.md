BMedSci | MSc - Mental Health and Climate Epidemiology
--
My main research focus is understanding how climate change impacts the physical and mental health of specific populations. This focus **(Climate Epidemiology)** has been part of my academic journey alongside other research fields **(Public Health and Psychiatric Epidemiology)**.

Since July 2024, I have been a PhD student in Ana M Vicedo-Cabrera's research group **(Climate Change and Health)** at the **Oeschger-Zentrum für Klimaforschung** (Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research) and the **Institut für Sozial- und Präventivmedizin** (Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine) at the University of Bern in Switzerland. My PhD research involves investigating the psychological consequences of extreme weather events and climate-related hazards to understand the effects of climate change on mental health in Switzerland and The Gambia.

**Climate stripes** visually represent the rise in global temperatures. Created by Ed Hawkins in 2018, each stripe represents a year, with blue for cooler and red for warmer years. Their simplicity effectively communicates climate change, highlighting the warming trend.

**Baseline periods** can be used to generate climate stripes, comparing temperature anomalies against different historical averages, such as 1951-1980, 1961-1990, and 1981-2010. Using various baselines shows how recent warming trends compare to past norms, emphasizing the urgency of addressing climate change.
