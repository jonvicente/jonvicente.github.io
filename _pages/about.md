Bachelor of Science (BSc) with a major in Biomedicine (BMedSci) from **Anhembi Morumbi University - UAM** (2014 - 2017), and also obtained a certificate in Political Science from **USCS - the University of São Caetano do Sul** (2019 - 2020), where I researched the Brazilian public health system and politics [**"Political Process for the Creation of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) based on the law 8.080"**](https://www.academia.edu/41132449/POL%C3%8DTICAS_P%C3%9ABLICAS_PROCESSO_POL%C3%8DTICO_DE_CRIA%C3%87%C3%83O_DO_SISTEMA_%C3%9ANICO_DE_SA%C3%9ADE_SUS_COM_BASE_NA_LEI_8_080_90).

In addition, I have completed a Master of Science (MSc) degree in Public Health from the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Faculty of Medicine of the **University of São Paulo - USP** (2020 - 2022) where I conducted a research thesis [**"The Influence of COVID-19 on Mental Health of Health Workers in the Hospital and Intensive Care Unit: Scoping Review"**](https://doi.org/10.11606/D.5.2023.tde-08052023-155935).

Research and Memberships
-----
My primary focus is to comprehensively comprehend the intricate interplay between climate change/variables and its profound physical and mental health impacts. I delve into the realms of Public Health, Global Mental Health, Psychiatric Epidemiology, Suicidology, Environmental & Climate Epidemiology, meticulously investigating how these multifaceted disciplines converge under the influence of climate change. Additionally, I explore the repercussions of disease outbreaks within the context of mental health, uncovering the intricate links that bind these domains in the face of shifting environmental dynamics.

Science Communication
-----
While researchers typically aim to communicate the findings of their work to other researchers, there are instances where they may wish to convey their research to a broader audience, including policymakers and the general public. As a researcher with experience in science communication, I have compiled a collection of my work to assist fellow scientists in effectively communicating their research to these diverse audiences on X (former twitter).
