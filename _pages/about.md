BMedSci | MSc - Mental Health and Climate Epidemiology
--
My primary focus is to comprehensively comprehend the intricate interplay between climate change/variables and its profound physical and mental health impacts. I delve into the realms of Public Health, Global Mental Health, Psychiatric Epidemiology, Suicidology, Environmental & Climate Epidemiology, meticulously investigating how these multifaceted disciplines converge under the influence of climate change. Additionally, I explore the repercussions of disease outbreaks within the context of mental health, uncovering the intricate links that bind these domains in the face of shifting environmental dynamics.

**Climate stripes** visually represent the rise in global temperatures. Created by Ed Hawkins in 2018, each stripe represents a year, with blue for cooler years and red for warmer years. Their simplicity effectively communicates climate change, highlighting the warming trend clearly.

**Baseline periods** can be used to generate climate stripes, comparing temperature anomalies against different historical averages, such as 1951-1980, 1961-1990, and 1981-2010. Using various baselines shows how recent warming trends compare to past norms, emphasizing the urgency of addressing climate change.
