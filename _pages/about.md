My primary focus is to comprehensively comprehend the intricate interplay between climate change/variables and its profound physical and mental health impacts. I delve into the realms of Public Health, Global Mental Health, Psychiatric Epidemiology, Suicidology, Environmental & Climate Epidemiology, meticulously investigating how these multifaceted disciplines converge under the influence of climate change. Additionally, I explore the repercussions of disease outbreaks within the context of mental health, uncovering the intricate links that bind these domains in the face of shifting environmental dynamics.
