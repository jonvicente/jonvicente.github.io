Science Communication
-----
While researchers typically aim to communicate the findings of their work to other researchers, there are instances where they may wish to convey their research to a broader audience, including policymakers and the general public. As a researcher with experience in science communication, I have compiled a collection of my work to assist fellow scientists in effectively communicating their research to these diverse audiences on twitter.
