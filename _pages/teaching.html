ADDING THE METRIC OF TIME TO THE GLOBAL WARMING CONVERSATION
<p><p>
In signing the Paris Agreement, the world has committed to limiting the global average temperature increase to between 1.5 and well-below 2Â°C above pre-industrial averages, so as to avoid the most dangerous consequences of global warming. But how far away is this threshold? And what do we need to do to change direction? The Climate Clock acts as a public line in the sand and says, this is the date. It is a measuring stick by which we can evaluate our progress.
<p></p>
The Climate Clock is based on the best available science and is updated each year to reflect the latest data by a team of leading climate scientists from around the world. Each year, we are able to show how close we are to the lower limit of the Paris temperature goal, and can measure whether we gained or lost time over the past year.

Humanity has the power to add time to the Clock, but only if we work collectively and measure our progress against defined targets.
